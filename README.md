# gRPC communication between Python and Rust

This repo provide 2 extremely simple examples to demonstrate the gRPC connection between Python and Rust. There are several bash scripts to explain how to run these 2 examples.

## Greeter

Run a gRPC server with Rust backend and send Hello message to it from the Python or Rust gRPC client.

## Matrix Operation

Generate 2 matrices in Python client and do multiply operation in the Python/Rust gRPC server to compare the efficiency when the computation is large enough.
